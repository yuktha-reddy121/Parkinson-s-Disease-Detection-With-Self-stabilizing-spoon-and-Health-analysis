The project aims to detect <b> Parkinson's disease <b> early using advanced health monitoring and data analysis. It also provides a <b> self-stabilizing spoon <b> to help patients with tremors eat independently, improving their quality of life and reducing caregiver dependence.<br><br>
Features used:<br>
  **`Pulse Oxygen (SpO2)`**<br>
  **`Temperature`**<br>
  **`Accelerometer`**<br>
  **`Heart Rate`**<br>
  **`ESP32 Chip`**<br>

## Overview:
The project objectives that are being resolved are:
<br>• To monitor an individual's heart rate and temperature and send a notification to theirregistered contact in case of abnormalities.
<br>• To create an automatic medicine reminder system for older individuals to ensure theytake their medicine on time.
<br>• To design and develop a system that can help the healthcare industry to overcome the disabilities caused by Parkinson's disease.

## Tools and Framework:
IoT: **`Arduino IDE 2.0`** **`C++ 22`**
<br>Machine Learning: **`Python 3.11`** **`GUI Interface`** 
<br>Interface: **`Blynk App`** 
<br>Hardware Tools: **`NodeMCU`** **`MAX30100`**

## Features:
### System Architecture
The system architecture has 3 phases where it involves Data Processing, Data Transformation and Prediction.
<br>• Load and pre-process the dataset.
<br>• Split the processed data into train and test dataset.
<br>• Transform the data by scaling using mean and standard deviation.
<br>• Train and validate the model using the train dataset to fetch a best fit model.
<br>• Pass the sensor fetched real time data to predict the Voice Frequency value.

### Testing Evaluation
1. Data Collection: 
**`Valid Data Collection`** **`Data Synchronization`** **`Sensor Displacement`** **`Sensor Calibration`**
2. Data Pre-Processing:
**`Missing Data`** **`Outlier Detection`** **`Data Validation`**
3. IoT Module:
**`Hand Tremors Measurement`** **`Signal Stability`** **`Sensor Placement`**
4. Interface Model:
**`Parkinson's Disease Prediction`** **`Clinical Range Alert`** **`User Interface Responsiveness`**

## Getting Started:
To get started with the project, you will need to download andinstall the required modules & libs specified in the **`Libraries_Required`** readme file.
Make sure you have the following tool to run and view the project working: **`Visual Code`** and the frameworks listed in the **`Tools and Framework`** block. Once you get the local host url, input the coresponding input values of a person to get the model training for the predicted Parkinson's Disease.

    <strong> Welcome Page of the project </strong> <br> <br>
    <strong> Parkinson's Disease </strong> is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, causing symptoms like tremors, stiffness, and slowed movements. It results from the loss of <strong>dopamine-producing brain cells<strong>. <br>
    <strong> Dopamine  </strong> is a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating movement, motivation, and pleasure. It helps transmit signals between nerve cells.
</p>
<p>The pill reminder system alerts elderly individuals to take their medication on time, enhancing adherence and ensuring consistent treatment. It integrates with health monitoring platforms, providing timely reminders and reducing the risk of missed doses, which helps maintain better overall health.</p>
